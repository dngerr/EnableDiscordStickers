# How To Enable Discord Stickers
Stickers only being available for people in canada is gay so here is how to enable discord stickers no matter where you are.

- Copy the script in the .js file to get the console command to enable the experiments menu. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + I` in discord (or `âŒ˜COMMAND + SHIFT + I` if you use mac) to open the console. This won't work if you're on mobile. Paste the text from the .js file and hit enter.
- Once you have run the script, go to your settings and scroll down until you find the experiments. ![yeah](https://github.com/dngerr/EnableDiscordStickers/blob/main/Images/ExperimentsMenu.png)
- Open the Experiments menu and type `Sticker` into the search bar. Set all 3 options that appear to Treatment 1. ![alsoyeah](https://github.com/dngerr/EnableDiscordStickers/blob/main/Images/StickerMenu.png)
- Once you've done that, you should see a new option where the GIF and emoji buttons are at the bottom of the screen. 
  - I'm not going to put an image for this because it's pretty obvious where it is.

It would be epic if you guys shared this because stickers should be a thing for everyone but yeah that's about it.
